/*
2. The `viewCart()` function does not accept any arguments. 
It should loop over every item in your cart, printing out the contents as one long, 
coherent statement in this format: `In your cart, you have bananas at $17, pancake batter at $5, and eggs at $49.`
    + If the cart is empty, the function should instead print out `Your shopping cart is empty.`
    + ***Note***: Pay close attention to the syntax above. The printed statement 
    should be a single sentence that begins with `In your cart, you have `,
     terminates in a period, and can assume the following shapes according to how many items the cart contains:
      * 1 item — `In your cart, you have bananas at $17.`
      * 2 items — `In your cart, you have bananas at $17 and pancake batter at $5.`
      * 3+ items — `In your cart, you have bananas at $17, pancake batter at $5, and eggs at $49.`
